The 57 features are:
[0,22): amino acid residues, with the order of 'A', 'C', 'E', 'D', 'G', 'F', 'I', 'H', 'K', 'M', 'L', 'N', 'Q', 'P', 'S', 'R', 'T', 'W', 'V', 'Y', 'X','NoSeq'
[22,31): Secondary structure labels, with the sequence of 'L', 'B', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'H', 'S', 'T','NoSeq'
[31,33): N- and C- terminals;
[33,35): relative and absolute solvent accessibility, used only for training. (absolute accessibility is thresholded at 15; relative accessibility is normalized by the largest accessibility value in a protein and thresholded at 0.15; original solvent accessibility is computed by DSSP)
[35,57): sequence profile. Note the order of amino acid residues is ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWXY and it is different from the order for amino acid residues
