Models Directory stores all the Python code for all of the created models.
Directory used for building, fitting and evaluating models locally.
<br>

Current model hyperparameters are ones that have proved to give the greatest accuracy and loss metrics.

**Note!** <br>
If running locally, ensure to use a small portion of the training dataset as well as large batch_size due to the complexity of the networks. If the full dataset is required to train the models then consider using the GCP and or AWS implementations in psp_aws & psp_gcp directories.
